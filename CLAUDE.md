# Contributing to cortextOS

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grandamenium/cortextos.git
cd cortextos
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

## Before Submitting Changes

1. `npm run build` — TypeScript must compile cleanly
2. `npm test` — all tests must pass
3. Match existing patterns in `src/` for new features
4. Add unit tests in `tests/` for any new code

## Project Structure

- `src/` — TypeScript source (bus, cli, daemon, hooks, types, utils)
- `bus/` — Shell wrapper scripts (delegate to `dist/cli.js bus`)
- `dashboard/` — Next.js 14 web dashboard
- `templates/` — Agent templates (agent, orchestrator, analyst)
- `community/` — Community skills and agent catalog
- `tests/` — Unit, integration, and E2E tests

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode
- No external runtime dependencies beyond what's in `package.json`
- File operations use atomic writes (see `src/utils/atomic.ts`)
- All bus operations go through `src/bus/` modules

## graphify

This project has a graphify knowledge graph at graphify-out/.

Rules:
- Before answering architecture or codebase questions, read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md for god nodes and community structure
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, navigate it instead of reading raw files
- For cross-module "how does X relate to Y" questions, prefer `graphify query "<question>"`, `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"`, or `graphify explain "<concept>"` over grep — these traverse the graph's EXTRACTED + INFERRED edges instead of scanning files
- After modifying code files in this session, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost)
